# JSBattle
JSBattle is a multiplayer game where players compete against each other by completing JavaScript coding challenges in real time. This project was completed as the Flex 1907 Capstone at FullStack Academy in NYC. The project team consisted of [Maria Lapshina](https://github.com/MariaSLapshina), [Zach Levine](https://github.com/zblevine), and [Jesen Tanadi](https://github.com/jtanadi).
